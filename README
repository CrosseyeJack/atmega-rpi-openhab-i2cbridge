An appliaction that I plan to use to bridge a ATMega to OpenHAB running on a 
Raspberry Pi

A Work in progress project.

Having a quick think I think I might just use a "special" prefix for my items 
for example fmk-<boardid>-<pin> So the current hardcoded temp sensor would have
 an item ID of fmk_6002_A0 (I can't use hyphons in the url, doh)

I think I will give it a shot. Might as well.

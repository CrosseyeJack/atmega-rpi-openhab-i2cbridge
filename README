An appliaction that I plan to use to bridge a ATMega to OpenHAB running on a Raspberry Pi

Work in progress project.

As this application currently links to the wiringPi project (http://wiringpi.com/) which is covered under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 this WIP is also under the same license.

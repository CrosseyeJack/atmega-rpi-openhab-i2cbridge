An appliaction that I plan to use to bridge a ATMega to OpenHAB running on a Raspberry Pi

Work in progress project.

Having a quick think I think I might just use a "special" prefix for my items for example fmk-<boardid>-<pin>
So the current hardcoded temp sensor would have an item ID of fmk-6002-A0 

I think I will give it a shot. Might as well.

As this application currently links to the wiringPi project (http://wiringpi.com/) which is covered under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 this WIP is also under the same license.
